If you have ever struggled with [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) or JSON configurations that get out of hand, you are not alone. Frustrated by how quickly these formats can get complicated, I decided to create my own [Domain-Specific Language (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) in Ruby. What started as a simple learning exercise turned into a powerful tool that made configuration management much simpler. Here’s what I learned from building this DSL and how it transformed my approach to handling complex configurations.

#### The challenges with traditional config formats
YAML and JSON are widely used for configuration, but they have their limits. As configurations grow more complex, these formats can become cumbersome and error-prone. I needed a solution that would make managing these complexities easier and more intuitive.

#### Creating a Toy DSL in Ruby
Ruby’s [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming) features make it a great choice for building a DSL. I created a basic DSL to handle configurations more elegantly. Here’s a look at the [`ConfigParser`](https://github.com/vaisakhvm/config-parser-dsl/blob/main/config_parser.rb) class I came up with:

{% highlight ruby %}
class ConfigParser
  def initialize(file)
    @file = file
    @config = {}
  end

  def parse
    instance_eval(File.read(@file))
  end

  def server(name, &block)
    @config[:server] = { name: name }
    instance_eval(&block)
  end

  def port(number)
    @config[:server][:port] = number
  end

  def enable_ssl(value)
    @config[:server][:enable_ssl] = value
  end

  def to_h
    @config
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

With this DSL, configurations are defined using a clear, readable syntax. Instead of wrestling with complex YAML or JSON, I use straightforward Ruby code that is easier to manage.

#### Example Configuration
Here’s an example of how you can write a configuration using my DSL (config.dsl):

{% highlight ruby %}
server 'vaisakhvm.in' do
  port 80
  enable_ssl true
end
{% endhighlight %}

When processed, this DSL configuration translates to a YAML format like this:

{% highlight yaml %}
server:
  name: vaisakhvm.in
  port: 80
  enable_ssl: true
{% endhighlight %}

#### What I Learned
One of the key takeaways from this project was understanding the simplicity and clarity that a DSL can bring to complex configurations. By designing an internal DSL in Ruby, it became evident how a custom syntax can simplify intricate setups and make the configuration process much more manageable.

I also learned about the power of Ruby’s metaprogramming features. These features are incredibly effective for creating a DSL that is both flexible and tailored to specific needs, without introducing excessive complexity into the codebase.

Beyond just creating an internal DSL, this project also reminded me of the broader landscape of DSLs, particularly the distinction between [internal and external DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language#External_and_Embedded_Domain_Specific_Languages). While an internal DSL is embedded within a host language like Ruby, an external DSL is a standalone language with its own syntax and parser. Each type has its strengths: internal DSLs are easier to integrate within existing projects, while external DSLs offer more freedom in language design at the cost of additional complexity.

Understanding these different approaches deepened my appreciation for the flexibility and potential of DSLs. Whether you're working within the constraints of an existing language or designing a new one from scratch, DSLs can transform complex tasks into something much more manageable and efficient.

# Hi! I'm Vaisakh VM 👋

I'm a software engineer interested in computer science, programming languages and building products, with a keen eye for user experience.

I work at ChistaDATA Inc as a Platform Engineer. Previously, I was an engineer, team lead and technical product manager. Since COVID, I've been working remotely from India	with teams across the Americas, Southeast Asia and Europe.

In 2018, I co-founded [Vizpalm](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vizpalm). In early 2019, I refined my startup skills through a mentorship program at [IIM Kozhikode](https://twitter.com/IIMKozhikode), thanks to [IIMK LIVE](https://twitter.com/iimk_live) and the [Kerala Startup Mission](https://twitter.com/startup_mission).

I’m big on cricket, having played at the first division level and been part of the under-19 probables in Calicut. I still play occasionally. 🏏

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.in/in/vaisakhvm), [Github](https://github.com/vaisakhvm), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaisakhvm)—feel free to connect!
